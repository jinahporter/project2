### Description of Project:
Create an interactive web application that allows our user to parse and visualize a data set of trending YouTube videos from the United States, Canada, Brazil and Mexico. The aim was to allow a user dig into the data to better understand the data. Questions such as "What video categories are the most watched in the US compared to Canada?", "The relationship between no. of views and interactions (likes, comments etc.)" could be answered using our web app. Data was sourced from Kaggle. 

### Tools Used:
Python and pandas in a jupyter notebook for data cleaning, 
Data was stored in a PostgreSQL data based
A Flask RESTful API was built to interact with the database and the JavaScript and HTML code, 
HTML/CSS, JavaScript were used to create the web page
and Plotly was used for visualization
